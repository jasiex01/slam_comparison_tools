# SLAM Comparison Tools

This repository documents the data collected during comparative analysis of SLAM algorithms and contains the Python scripts used in offline analysis. Compared algorithms were: GMapping, SLAM Toolbox, RTAB-Map (two configurations - one with 2D LiDAR, one with RGB-D camera).

## Contents

- **[ground_truths](ground_truths)**: reference maps of each environment.
- **[pose_csvs](pose_csvs)**: estimated and ground truth poses of each algorithm in each world.
- **[ram_csvs](ram_csvs)**: RAM usage data of each algorithm.
- **[slam_analysis_output](slam_analysis_output)**: output of offline analysis of SLAM position estimation. Contains plots showing average errors and errors over time and trajectory comparison.
- **[test_results](test_results)**: contains maps generated by each algorithm and results of the `rotop` tool for each of the algorithms
- **[pose_stats.py](pose_stats.py)**: script generating the contents of the **slam_analysis_output** folder.
- **[slam_map_compare.py](slam_map_compare.py)**: script evaluating quality metrics of the generated maps.

## Usage

To run any of the provided scripts:

```bash
python3 <script_name>.py
```

> **Note:** Ensure all required libraries are installed in your environment.
